            <p>To our dear Alne,</p>

            <p>
                Happy, happy birthday! Today is your special day, and I just want to say how truly thankful I am to have you in my life. Thank you for always being there whenever I needed someone to talk to, for listening to all my random stories and chika without judgment, and for making me feel heard and understood.
            </p>

            <p>
                Weâ€™ve been friends since Grade 9, and nothing has changed â€” weâ€™re still as close as ever. I still remember the very first day we talked and Iâ€™ll always cherish that moment because thatâ€™s one of the best friendships in my life began.
            </p>

            <p>
                Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t get you a gift in your birthday. Iâ€™ve been so busy, but I truly hope this letter means something to you. It may not be fancy, and Iâ€™m not into arts (you know that), but every word here comes from the heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for being you, Alne â€” genuine, caring, and constant. Iâ€™m so grateful for you, and I hope this year brings you all the happiness you deserve.
            </p>

            <p>
                Happy birthday, my Alne ðŸ’›
            </p>
